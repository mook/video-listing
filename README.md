# video-listing

This is a small application to track watched videos.

- The user supplies a directory to manage.
- This starts a web server, listing directories and files.
- When a file is watched, the user clicks on a button labelled "Seen".
- Watched files are displayed grayed out
- If a whole directory is watched, that directory will also be grayed out.
